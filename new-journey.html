                    <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
                    <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what i leaned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world</p>

                    <h2>How I got started</h2>
                    <p>I started simple and gradually grew my leaning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session. I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
                    <p>That helped me grow what I was learning, and I releaised that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay connected.</p>
